## Introduction

- My Birthday is February 7th, which is Chinese New Year in my born year.
- I grew up in China and finish my first three years of bachelor's degree in China. And then I went to American to finish my fourth year and continue studying.
- I am working in the Food Science department, focusing on food processing.
- Hopefully, I plan to graduate next May. 

## Favorite animal

## Favorite plot

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Fig 2. Scatterplot --- y=2*x + x"}
par(las=1)
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(n)
plot(x, y, pch=16, col="slateblue")
```
- This is the scatterplot, x is 100 points that followed normal distribution and y equals 2*x + x.
